  * Khalil Nijaoui 40092653
  * Michel Abboud 40025378

## Goal
* In this assignment, we explore the use of Depth-first Search, Iterative Deepening, and A* heuristic algorithms to solve an N-Slide puzzle.
* Each algorithm is challenged to solve the same random puzzles, and speed, cost, and other metrics of algorithm performance are collected. 

## Submission Contents
* This submission contains:
	* `/inputs`
		* Contains the randomly generated tuples for the puzzles
	* `/presentation`
		* Contains presentation material for demo (i.e. ppt)
	* `results_3x3` and `results_4x4`
		* Holds the results for the algorithm outputs for each of the 20 random puzzles
	* `/src`
		* Holds the source files for the project (i.e. .py files)
## How to Run
* Clone this repository
* Open in IDE of your choice (or command line)
* Run `main.py` and generated results will be outputted in a directory named `/results`
